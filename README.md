# Beech
Beech is a CMS-like system that presents XML files in HTML using XLST

# XML Elements
Beech uses the following elements:
headline, author, date, body

The author and date elements are optional, but you just have to use the page template instead of the blog post one
  
In the future, I hope to add a backend UI and more elements. But let's just keep things simple for now!
